Hakha Chin UD Decisions:
1. á¹­ = tt

2. Sometimes if there is a nominal subject the verbal prefix is being marked as a dep because it is unclear what it is. If there is no nom sbj then the prefix is treated as the nom sbj of the sentence. One possible annotation is that it is an AUX to the verb. This will be looked into.
	2a. Will re-make these into expletives in further updates, will be using expeletives from now on and will fix the rest later 8/28 BM.
		- Fixed some of them, will have to check them later 9/10 BM
	2b. Is pawl the plural marked for SBJs and hna the one for ObJs?! 8/28 BM
	2c. Eng transitive verbs can be intransitive in CNH, go for instance can in INTR when there is no particle 'piak' meaning there is no OBJ agreement marker, it's marked obliquely. I am still marking the nom obj as obj of the verb and there is a null obj marker which is not represented in the trees. 9/11 BM

3. Keimah ka min = I call/name my(self). Min has another word sense in HC and it's a verb. Similar to Je m'appelle in French. So Keimah ka min cu ChinChin a si = It is ChinChin that I call/name myself

4. HC has adjectival verbs so adjectives will be annotated as verbs.

5. Verbs are not usually annotated with tense unless there is a verbal modifier indicating tense.

6. How to annotate neg marker 'lo'?
	- It's being glossed as a PART but I'm unsure of its relation. It's usually given the discourse relation.

7. Verbal adj are annotated as VERB with the XPOS = ADJ

8. Punctuation that was not in the common voice file is not in the treebank.
